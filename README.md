# Good Looking, Good Rating? Beauty Premium in the Course Evaluation

Authors: Kuang Sheng & Liyan Wang

	Do physically attractive professors receive more favorable student evaluations? 
	
	This project builds a machine-learning pipeline that predicts professors’ course evaluation outcomes from facial images. 
	
	We will construct a biographical dataset of professors from several U.S. universities, combining portrait photos with third-party evaluation measures from RateMyProfessors (RMP).
	
	Using an established deep-learning model (Liang et al., 2018) for facial attractiveness prediction, we will generate a standardized “beauty score” for each professor and link it to their RMP ratings. 
	
	We will then train and compare multiple predictive models, such as linear regression with regularization (Ridge/Lasso), logistic regression (for high- vs. low-rating classification), and gradient-boosted trees (e.g., XGBoost), to assess predictive performance and identify the most suitable approach for this task.

## RateMyProfessors Crawler

This repository includes a crawler script that fetches professor ratings for UCLA and NYU (Computer Science and Fine Arts) from RateMyProfessors and writes them to a CSV file.
