# Good Looking, Good Rating? Beauty Premium in the Course Evaluation

- Authors: Kuang Sheng & Liyan Wang

- Instructor: Markus Neumann

## Research Question

  Do physically attractive professors receive more favorable student evaluations? 
  
  This project builds a machine-learning pipeline that predicts professors’ course evaluation outcomes from facial images. We will construct a biographical dataset of professors from several U.S. universities, combining portrait photos with third-party evaluation measures from RateMyProfessors (RMP). Using an established deep-learning model (Liang et al., 2018) for facial attractiveness prediction, we will generate a standardized “beauty score” for each professor and link it to their RMP ratings. 
  We will then train and compare multiple predictive models, such as linear regression with regularization (Ridge/Lasso), logistic regression (for high- vs. low-rating classification), and gradient-boosted trees (e.g., XGBoost), to assess predictive performance and identify the most suitable approach for this task.

## Division of Responsibilities

### Kuang Sheng
- **Primary responsibilities**
  - Web-scrape faculty profile photos from university/department websites
  - Train predictive models (logistic regression; gradient-boosted trees such as XGBoost)
  - Evaluate model performance (e.g., MAE/RMSE/AUC; cross-validation as needed)
  - Draft the report and visualize key results
- **Tasks completed this week**
  - Proposed the research question and identified feasible data sources, scraping tools, and a facial beauty prediction model
  - Collected faculty photos from the NYU and UCLA computer science department websites

### Liyan Wang
- **Primary responsibilities**
  - Web-scrape professor ratings from RateMyProfessors (RMP)
  - Apply the pre-trained deep-learning model to generate professors’ beauty scores
  - Train baseline predictive models (linear regression with/without regularization)
  - Draft the report and visualize key results
- **Tasks completed this week**
  - Collected RMP data for NYU and UCLA to validate the feasibility of the data pipeline
  - Produced descriptive-statistics plots to summarize the pilot dataset


## RateMyProfessors Crawler

This repository includes a crawler script that fetches professor ratings for UCLA and NYU (Computer Science and Fine Arts) from RateMyProfessors and writes them to a CSV file.

## Faculty Photo Scraper

This repository also includes a web scraper script that fetches professors' photos for UCLA and NYU (Computer Science) from university websites.

## SCUT-FBP5500 Beauty Score Inference (CSV)

This repo includes a script that loads the pretrained SCUT-FBP5500 PyTorch models and appends a `beauty_score` column to a CSV containing image paths.

### 1) Download the pretrained model

From the official SCUT-FBP5500 release: https://github.com/HCIILAB/SCUT-FBP5500-Database-Release

- Download the **PyTorch** trained models archive and extract it locally.
- Choose one of the `.pth` files, such as `alexnet.pth` or `resnet18.pth`.

### 2) Prepare your CSV

Your CSV should include a column with image paths. For example:

```csv
name,image_path
Professor A,/path/to/image_a.jpg
Professor B,/path/to/image_b.jpg
```

### 3) Run inference

```bash
python beauty_score_from_csv.py \
  --input-csv professors.csv \
  --image-column image_path \
  --model-arch alexnet \
  --weights /path/to/alexnet.pth \
  --output-csv professors_with_scores.csv
```

If images are relative paths, they will be resolved relative to the CSV file location. Any failures are logged to an `_errors.txt` file alongside the output CSV.
